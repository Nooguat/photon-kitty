### article

-   if article doesn't have a image and card has, than use that
-   ctrl+shift+u will show link hints like in alacritty

### status bar

-   show what feed is currently downloading
-   show media playing

### documentation

-   '?' for keybindings
-   man pages (this needs then a makefile and scdoc)
-   lua man pages
-   lua tutorial in md
-   lua http tutorial

### ideas:

-   rewrite mercury to go and use that as article extractor?
-   add arg to use mercury-parser as article extractor?
