### article

-   keybinding to circle the card description, card content or the article parsed content
-   if article doesn't have a image and card has, than use that

### status bar

-   show what feed is currently downloading
-   show media playing

### plugins

-   for reddit link type posts, opening the article with the link to the web page instead of the reddit post

### documentation

-   man pages (this needs then a makefile and scdoc)
-   better readme

### distribution

-   aur package

### ideas:

-   rewrite mercury to go and use that as article extractor
