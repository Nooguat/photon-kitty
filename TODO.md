## bugs

-   on resize event in normal state, resize the images only if the width changed

### card

-   add a tiny feed icon
-   check if there is place for the author name

### article

-   article - show author and date
-   center article image
-   scroll article with the image
-   status bar - show percentage in article scroll, like in vim (Top-percent-Bot or All)
-   keybinding to toggle the card description or the article parsed content

### status bar

-   show what feed is currently downloading
-   show media playing

### plugins

-   for reddit link type posts, opening the article with the link to the web page instead of the reddit post
